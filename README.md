# Ultrasound-ToF-DTFT
This repository provides code to simulate ultrasound pulses and echoes, estimating the time-of-flight (ToF) using the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT). The script computes ToF through frequency-domain cross-correlation and visualizes the results in time and frequency domains for non-destructive testing (NDT) applications.
